## App-Specific Questions

### Q: Explain the overall architecture of your Diary app.

**A:** The app follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with Clean Architecture principles:

- **UI Layer**: Fragments and Activities using ViewBinding
- **ViewModel Layer**: DiaryViewModel managing UI state and business logic
- **Repository Layer**: DiaryRepository handling data operations
- **Data Layer**: Room Database for local storage
- **Base Classes**: BaseActivity and BaseFragment for common functionality
- **Navigation**: Using Navigation Component for screen transitions

### Q: How do you handle multiple languages in the app?

**A:** The app implements internationalization through:

1. Multiple resource files (strings.xml) for different languages
2. LocaleHelper utility class for runtime language switching
3. PreferencesDataStore for persisting language preferences
4. Language selection screen with immediate UI updates
5. Supported languages: English, Hindi, Spanish, French, Arabic, Bengali

### Q: How do you manage image handling in the app?

**A:** Image handling is implemented through:

1. ImageUtils class for compression and storage
2. Internal storage for saving compressed images
3. URI-based image references in the database
4. RecyclerView with adapters for image display
5. Permission handling for storage access
6. Glide for efficient image loading

### Q: Explain the data persistence strategy in your app.

**A:** The app uses multiple persistence mechanisms:

1. Room Database for diary entries
2. DataStore Preferences for app settings
3. Internal storage for images
4. Type converters for complex data types
5. Foreign key relationships for related data

## Architecture Questions

### Q: What are the benefits of using MVVM in this app?

**A:**

1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Better testability
3. Lifecycle-aware components
4. Reduced coupling between UI and business logic
5. Easy state management through LiveData/StateFlow

### Q: How do you handle configuration changes?

**A:**

1. ViewModel survives configuration changes
2. Saved instance state for critical data
3. ViewBinding for view references
4. StateFlow/LiveData for UI updates
5. Proper lifecycle management

### Q: Explain your navigation strategy.

**A:**

1. Single Activity architecture
2. Navigation Component for fragment management
3. Safe Args for type-safe navigation
4. Custom animations for transitions
5. Deep linking support

## Android-Specific Questions

### Q: How do you handle runtime permissions?

**A:**

1. Permission checking before accessing storage
2. Custom permission screen
3. Graceful fallbacks when permissions denied
4. Proper permission rationale
5. Settings redirect when needed

### Q: Explain your UI component hierarchy.

**A:**

1. BaseActivity as the main container
2. Fragments for different screens
3. Custom views for reusable components
4. Material Design components
5. ViewBinding for view access

## Kotlin-Specific Questions

### Q: How do you use Kotlin features in your app?

**A:**

1. Data classes for models
2. Extension functions for utility methods
3. Coroutines for async operations
4. Flow for reactive programming
5. Property delegation
6. Null safety features

### Q: Explain your use of coroutines.

**A:**

3. Structured concurrency
4. Error handling with supervisorScope
5. Proper cancellation handling

## General Programming Questions

### Q: Explain SOLID principles in context of your app.

**A:**

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one purpose
2. **Open/Closed**: Base classes for extension
3. **Liskov Substitution**: Proper inheritance hierarchy
4. **Interface Segregation**: Focused interfaces
5. **Dependency Inversion**: Repository pattern

### Q: What design patterns are used?

**A:**

1. Repository Pattern
2. Observer Pattern (Flow/LiveData)
3. Builder Pattern (MaterialAlertDialog)
4. Factory Pattern (ViewModels)
5. Singleton Pattern (Database)
