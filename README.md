# 🗒️ Yet Another Diary App

#### (Because the world definitely needed one more...)

## 🤔 What's This?

A technical assessment for DKTechGlobal where I pretend to know Android development. It's a diary app that supports 6 languages, because apparently, I love making things complicated for myself.

> **Plot Twist**: This project is basically me and AI pair programming, where AI does most of the heavy lifting while I nod along pretending to understand what's happening. But hey, we all start somewhere, right? 🤷‍♂️
>
> **Personal Note**: Really hoping DKTechGlobal sees past the AI assistance and gives me a chance at the next round. I promise to learn proper Android development and stop asking AI "what's a lifecycle?" every 5 minutes! 🙏

## ✨ Features That Actually Work (I Think)

- 🌍 Supports 6 languages (because English wasn't challenging enough)
- 📝 Create, edit, and delete diary entries (basic CRUD, but make it fancy)
- 🖼️ Multiple image attachments (because one picture isn't enough to capture my confusion)
- 😊 Emotion tracking (in case you want to log your frustration with Android development)
- 🔍 Search functionality (to find where it all went wrong)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

_(or "Things I'm Pretending to Understand")_

- **Kotlin**: Because Java wasn't confusing enough
- **MVVM Architecture**: Sounds fancy, doesn't it?
- **Room Database**: SQLite with a bowtie
- **Coroutines**: Magic threads that somehow work
- **Navigation Component**: Because `startActivity()` is so 2015
- **Glide**: Image loading black magic

## 🏗️ Project Structure

_(A.K.A. "Where Did I Put That File Again?")_

```
📦 app
 ┣ 📂 data (where the magic happens)
 ┣ 📂 ui (pretty stuff goes here)
 ┣ 📂 utils (random helper functions I copied from StackOverflow)
 ┗ 📂 di (dependency injection, because why make life easy?)
```

## 🎯 The Truth Behind The Code

Let's be real here:

- 70% AI assistance
- 20% StackOverflow
- 9% YouTube tutorials
- 1% Actually understanding what's going on

But hey, at least I'm honest about it! 🤷‍♂️

## 📚 Learning Goals

_(or "Things I Should Probably Know Already")_

1. Actually understand what SOLID means (besides being a cool acronym)
2. Learn design patterns (beyond Copy-Paste Pattern™)
3. Master MVVM (Model-View-ViewMagic?)
4. Figure out what the heck a coroutine really is
5. Stop relying on AI for everything (maybe...)

## 🎓 Current Knowledge Level

```kotlin
val androidKnowledge = when (confidence) {
    is Coding -> "What's a lifecycle?"
    is Architecture -> "MVVM has View in it twice, right?"
    is Kotlin -> "At least it's not Java"
    else -> "Stack Overflow is down, please try again later"
}

val nextRoundChances = when (honesty) {
    is High -> "At least I admitted I need AI's help!"
    is Medium -> "I promise to learn everything properly"
    is Low -> "Please give me a chance 🙏"
    else -> "I'll bring cookies to the interview!"
}
```

## 🙏 Honest Acknowledgments

Huge thanks to:

- ChatGPT for being my senior developer
- YouTube tutorials for making me feel like I know what I'm doing
- StackOverflow for the copy-paste solutions
- Coffee for keeping me awake through this
- DKTechGlobal for (hopefully) seeing potential through this chaos and giving me a shot at the next round!

## 🚀 Future Plans

1. Learn Android development properly (shocking, I know)
2. Understand at least 50% of the code I write
3. Make peace with the Android lifecycle
4. Stop googling "how to center a div" (wrong platform, but the habit persists)
5. Make DKTechGlobal proud if they give me a chance! 🙌
